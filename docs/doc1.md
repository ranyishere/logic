> Logic is the systematic study of valid rules of inference, i.e. the relations that lead to the acceptance of one proposition (the conclusion) on the basis of a set of other propositions (premises). More broadly, logic is the analysis and appraisal of arguments. - Wikipedia

## Purpose

This document was created to help mathematicians, logicians, and computer scientists as a reference. This document is a **highly opinionated way** to present mathematics in a formatted and rigorous way.

Each entry has:
* Definition
* Example
* Reference

such that no exposition or historical background are presented. Such information can be provided elsewhere and should be provided by references to get more information. The motivation for this
format is to become an easier reference for working mathematicians. The general idea is to mirror API references that we see in programming libraries.

For example see:
* https://www.w3schools.com/html/
* https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveJob/Arguments.html
* https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/v3/api/Aws/Appflow/Client.html
